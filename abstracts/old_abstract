Pentesters, admins, and IT folk are increasingly asked to do more with
less. There's not enough hours in the day to spend gathering security-related data, analyzing it, reacting to changes, etc. So how to compete?  This talk will present novel techniques to address this problem, by presenting easy-to-implement systems which can automate your workflow. A number of demos will be given: 

 * rbIPS - Monitoring your systems in novel ways (using ruby, audio, and jabber) for attacks and auto-attacking with metasploit
  - audiomon
  - jablog
  - log
  
 * metaBot - a ruby tool to give you a command an control channel into a system.
 
 * Porcupine - Integrate Metasploit to react to attacks as they're detected on your systems.
 
 * The Lab (a metasploit component which does VM automation for you)
 
 * Metacuke - A  slick DSL to write automated tests using Metasploit as an engine for testing.
 
 

Continuous Network Testing with Metasploit: How do we get there? Idea worth spreading

What should you test? Answer: everything, all the time
Response: It's not practical
Answer: yes it is. Using open source tools

 - How to alert on a database change 


Reconaissance:
 - Auto-configuration of google alerts
 - EAR (needs a ton of work)
  - Google scrape for emails
  - 
  - DNS Lookups
  - Metasploit Modules?
  
Discovery: 
 - Etherpeep
 - Nmap
 - How to schedule this? (pbnj-type functionality)
 
Attack & Post: (automating attack as new hosts pop up)
 - Automatic attack-back
 - Automatic blocking of malicious hosts - how to hook it all together?
 
 
Reporting / Alerting: 



You know /how/ to do this stuff, let's just make it easier.

This talk consists of a number of mini-projects designed to help pentesters and hackers get stuff done:
 * MetaRecon / EAR - Tools in metasploit to perform pentesting recon
 * The Lab - a metasploit component which does VM automation for you
 * RBot - a ruby tool to give you a command an control channel into a system
 * Porcupine  -  Integrate Metasploit to react to attacks as they're detected on your systems.
 * Cucumber vs Metasploit - A /very/ slick DSL to write automated tests using Metasploit as an engine for testing.
 * Doppleganger -
