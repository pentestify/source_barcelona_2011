80 hours combined
 
Basic Prereqs:
 
 * ERB Rc file [2]
 * RC Generator - erb, long-term website/service -KS
 * Scheduling inside the console [2]
 * RC bindings/variables [1]
 * alerting (plugin?) -- via twitter [3]
 * SESSIONS rather than SESSION [10]
 
 
1) Automating/modeling an attacker, make metasploit mimic this kind of attacker, go.  -KS
     - This can play into testing & training devices & people
     - I can probably work some of this on billable time
     - Automate an attack/attacker sequence/characteristic
     - Mimic/emulate/simulate different types of attacks/attackers
 
2) Creating and Automating a test lab [18] - jcran
    Fog shit to work  [5]
        Specify credentials, start an amazon box
        plugin work to make as usable as possible [10]
             - configure firewall
            -  configure ssh login to the box
    methods to generate sessions for additional testing [3]
 
3) Defender & User Training -KS
 
As a it guy, i want phish my users to train them not to click on shit.
 ** Requries a http server module that can host a warning message
 ** Requires a module to send emails 
 ** Requires an smtp module / server
 
As a it guy, i want to train my defenders how to recognize an attack
 ** possibly requires scheduling
 ** requires aherence to a strict schedule
 
 ** sample RC scripts for 
 *** exfiltration
 *** exploit attempts
 *** phishing attempts 
 *** vishing attacks 
 
4) Security Device Testing (vsploit) [??] -KS
 
As technical buyer or recommender, I want to test an IPS for volume, ability to catch common exploit attempts, and other xxx
 
tutorials? - rc files - hey what should i look for, and how do i practically do it
 
4b) Traffic Generation [10] -KS
4Force internet explorer to go to a particular location (post module?)
 
5) (Constant) Internal discovery and enumeration [40] - KS [40] - jcran
Discovery my own environment, does it match any expectations?
Compliance?
Reoccurring RC?  Alerting definitely has to be implemented by jcran
Some might be alert per instance run, e.g. No non-windows hosts
Some might be a background job on the db
Constant internal wtf in the db?
Provider/consumer, register auto-hooks in mods in init adds to provider, consumer is the auto-manger, PoC
 
 * how to rerun an RC file, of infinite loop 
 <ruby>
     Do {ATTACKER_STEP1}
    WAIT {ATTACKER_DELAY}
      run_single "resource #{__FILE__}"
    
</ruby>
 
would be neat to have a dashboard, 
 
more detail needed
 
6) APT Detection / Host Anomaly detection [20] - KS
 
As an admin, i want to look for differences between host's registry, simpleist case is dump the registry then diff, lib
 
7) Devops testing for regressions in network [15] -jcran
 
Feature: Fingerprint my systems
    In order to fingerprint systems on my network 
    As an adminstrator
    I want to fingerprint my systems via ssh, postgres, and smb
 
Feature: Default Password Check
        In order to avoid default passwords on my systems
        As an administrator
        I want to check systems for default accounts via SSH, FTP and RDP
 
Scenario: Check Default Logins on Production Systems
        Given I have a list of production systems
        And a list of default account names
        And a list of default passwords
        When I check for each combination on the production systems via ssh
        And i check ... via ftp
        and i check .. via rdp 
        Then I should have zero valid logins
 
 
8) IRC command and control [10] -jcran
finish bot plugins (nexpose, msf, pro, redmine)
 
9) DOS Testing: (4-8 hours) -jcran
 
integrate 
 
11) Pentesting - joint?  Doobie. [5]
    phish or ms08_067 / ms10_061 + evasion ->  erb for the email/phish
    escalate (how to escalate on windows 7?)
    dump hashes ->
    pass the hash -> 
    escalation / token hunting with jabra's modules
    post_exploitation looting
    pivoting
    repeat
 
 
 
X) Network Anomaly detection
 
As a user, i want to be able to query differences between machines
 
Db_fun searching & making sets
 
X) External discovery and enumeration
 
what would you look at? dns? pastebin? google alerts?
 
1) Automating Security Devices
 
As a network admin, i want to drive my vulnerability scanner
 
3) Test Network Devices? 
 
X) Network Research
 
X) Host anomaly detection
 
As an admin, i want to see if a particular issue is in the event log
 
X) Monitoring
 
Port scanning without sending a packet - https://media.defcon.org/dc-19/presentations/Pickett/DEFCON-19-Pickett-Port-Scanning-Without-Packets.pdf
Sniffing via sessions
 
X) Incident Detection & Response
 
* Log in and look for anomalies 
 
X) Forensics
 
* Would require an automated analysis of some sort
 
X) Automated Vuln Verification?
 
X) Automated Patch Verification?
 
X) Wireless
 
X) Web
 
X) Monitoring??
