This is a list of the priorities for the lab code...

1) Implement more technologies

 a) finish amazon ec2 (via fog)

 b) qemu

 c) qemudo

 d) kvm

 e) other cloud technologies (newservers, slicehost/rackspace,etc)

2) Implement a cloning function on each controller

3) Support Windows as a host platform. Currently all the code assumes a linux host is running it. The same applies for the remote_* drivers -- they've not been tested on windows.

4)
