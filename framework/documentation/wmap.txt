=[ Intro.

WMAP is a general purpose web application scanning framework for 
Metasploit 3. The architecture is simple and its simplicity is what makes
it powerful. It's a different approach compared to other open source 
alternatives and commercial scanners, as WMAP is not build around any browser 
or spider for data capture and manipulation. 


=[ How it works.

In the WMAP design, any tool can become a data gathering tool. In the 
general case an attack proxy can be modified to store all the traffic between 
the client(s) (i.e. favorite browser and/or spider). (See figure.) 

Notice that a client may be used to store data too.

WMAP is a Metasploit plugin and will interact with the database, reading all
gathered traffic, processing it and launching the different tests 
implemented as modules.  As tests are MSF Modules they can be easily 
implemented, and can be run manually from the command line or automatically 
via WMAP.

As you may see this simple architecture allows you to have different 
distributed clients and even different proxies all storing data to the 
central repository. Remember everything is based on Metasploit, the test 
modules are implemented as auxiliary modules and they can interact with any 
other MSF component including the database, exploits and plugins.


=[ WMAP Modules.
 	 
The test modules implemented at this time are basic and will improve over 
time not only in quality and quantity, so you are more than welcome to 
submit new modules.

Each module has a WMAP type, this determine when the module is launched and
to a certain degree, the minimum type of information it requires to be 
executed. The best way to develop a new test for WMAP, is to use already 
implemented modules as a base and then develop a normal MSF module that can 
be run manually from the command line. To enable a module to be run 
automatically via WMAP  just include the mixin that determine the type 
of the module. 

	Example:

	include Auxiliary::WMAPScanFile

The following are the types of modules implemented at this time and they are
listed in the order WMAP runs them:

WMAPScanSSL         - Run once against SSL server
WMAPScanServer      - Run once against the target Web Server
WMAPScanDir         - Runs for every directory found in the target 
WMAPScanFile        - Runs for every file found in the target
WMAPScanUniqueQuery - Runs for every unique query found in each request to the 
                      target 
WMAPScanQuery       - Runs for every query found in each request to the target
WMAPScanGeneric     - Modules to be run after all tests complete. Good place to
                      perform passive analysis of responses, analysis of test
                      results to launch other modules (i.e. exploits). 

=[ Reporting.

It uses the native reporting capabilities of MEtasploit.

=[ Database

No more sqlite. it uses whatever the framework is using.

=[ Simple example.

The following are the basic steps for testing a web server/app using WMAP: 

  1. Crawl a web site using the /auxiliary/scanner/http/crawler module
  2. Load the wmap plugin
  3. View available sites to test:
	
	wmap_sites -l

  4. View site structure

	wmap_sites -s <vhost,url>
	
	Example: wmap_sites -s www.testsite.org,http://192.168.1.1

  5. Define targets from available sites

	wmap_targets -t <vhost,url>

  6. Test it.

	wmap_run -e

=[ Additional Stuff

  Before runing the test you may need to set certain variables 
  required by some modules.

  Example:	 

      msf > setg DOMAIN targetco.com
      DOMAIN => targetco.com

      msf > setg EXT .asp
      EXT => .asp

      msf > setg WMAP_EXCLUDE_FILE <regex_to_exclude_testing_files>

            NOTE: By default image files are not included in the tests.	

      If required profiles can be defined in the following way:

            wmap_run -e path/to/profile/file

            The profile file contains the list of modules to execute.
            See data/wmap/wmap_sample.profile for a sample.		

=[ TODO. 
  

This is first real release version of WMAP and as you know, the Metasploit project
welcomes feedback, comments, ideas, patches, modules, etc.
